# CloakBrowser Workflow Rules

Use these rules when a run must install, configure, launch, or troubleshoot CloakBrowser with Playwright MCP.

## 1. Safety and Scope Gate

Proceed only when the browser task is authorized and bounded. Allowed cases include QA on owned properties, compatibility checks, monitoring, debugging user-visible flows, and agent browsing where the user has rights to access the target.

Decline or narrow requests involving unauthorized access, CAPTCHA solving, account creation abuse, credential attacks, payment/government/healthcare authentication automation, or restricted data scraping.

## 2. Preflight Question Gate

Operational requests must ask or confirm runtime inputs before setup, cookie loading, or browser launch. Use the host's native AskUserQuestion-style mechanism when available:

- Claude Code AskUserQuestion or equivalent structured question surface
- Codex native structured user input when available
- Gajae-Code/GJC question bridge or session prompt when available
- Cursor/client-native prompt when available
- one concise plain-text question only when no structured question surface exists

Ask one bundled preflight question. Do not scatter repeated prompts across setup steps. The preflight must cover:

- target URL/site when the request did not already specify it
- `headless` mode, defaulting to `true`
- visible/headed mode when the user says `headless false`, `headed`, `visible`, "브라우저 보이게", or selects visible browsing in preflight
- cookie mode: use existing `~/.hypercore-business/cookie.yml`, provide/update `cookie.yml`, or continue without cookies
- cookie site and account when cookies are used and the site/account is ambiguous
- profile/account label when the user wants session continuity or multiple identities
- keep-open preference, defaulting to close cleanly after completion

If the user's prompt already contains a value, do not re-ask it. Include the explicit value in the preflight summary and ask only for the missing or ambiguous fields.

Do not request raw cookie values unless cookies are needed and the user chooses to provide or update them. When raw cookies are provided, store them only in `~/.hypercore-business/cookie.yml`; never echo them back, screenshot them, or write them to the skill folder.

If `scripts/cookie.mjs inspect ... --json` or `scripts/browser-utils.mjs cookies ... --json` reports `needsAccount: true`, ask the user to choose from the returned `availableAccounts` before loading cookies.

## 3. Activation Setup Gate

For operational requests, run this gate before launching or configuring MCP. Do not stop at a written recipe when required setup is missing; perform the setup when the active environment allows it.

1. Check runtime:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

2. Confirm Node.js satisfies CloakBrowser JavaScript's current requirement, Node.js >= 20.

3. Pick the setup workspace:

- Use the existing project package manager when the user wants project-local setup.
- Use a temporary or user-level Node workspace when the current repository should not receive package changes.
- Do not modify unrelated package manifests just to run CloakBrowser once.

4. Check and install packages in the selected Node workspace:

```bash
npm install cloakbrowser@latest playwright-core@latest
```

5. Pre-download and inspect CloakBrowser:

```bash
npx cloakbrowser install
npx cloakbrowser info
```

6. Confirm Playwright MCP can be invoked with npx:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --help
```

7. Resolve the executable:

```bash
node skills/cloak-browser/scripts/resolve-cloak-mcp.mjs
```

8. Initialize the runtime workspace:

```bash
node skills/cloak-browser/scripts/browser-utils.mjs init
```

9. Launch Playwright MCP with the resolved executable:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --headless --executable-path /absolute/path/to/cloakbrowser/chrome
```

Do not run `playwright install chromium` as the default CloakBrowser setup path. CloakBrowser downloads its own Chromium binary; Playwright system dependencies may still be needed on Linux hosts.

If install or `npx` download fails because of network, sandbox, or registry access, follow the active environment's escalation policy. If escalation is unavailable, report that precise blocker and provide the command/config that will work after setup.

## 4. Runtime Workspace and Cookie Rules

- Use `~/.hypercore-business/` as the default runtime workspace for CloakBrowser runs.
- Create `cookie.yml`, `profiles/`, `downloads/`, `evidence/`, `logs/`, and `state/` before live browsing.
- Use `CLOAK_BROWSER_WORKSPACE` or `HYPERCORE_BUSINESS_HOME` only for sandboxed verification or an explicit alternate workspace.
- Load matching cookies from `~/.hypercore-business/cookie.yml` before visiting a target site when the user has supplied cookies.
- Use `scripts/cookie.mjs` for all cookie import, normalization, inspection, redaction, and Playwright injection.
- Support Chrome cookie export JSON, Playwright-compatible cookie arrays, the skill's `cookie.yml` schema, and legacy flat `cookies:` lists.
- Normalize Chrome export fields before injection: `expirationDate`/`expiry` become Playwright `expires`, `sameSite: no_restriction` becomes `None`, and `sameSite: unspecified` is omitted so Playwright may use its default.
- Support multiple cookies per site account and multiple accounts per site.
- If a matching site has multiple accounts and no `defaultAccount`, ask the user which account to use; do not guess.
- Treat cookie values as secrets. Do not echo, commit, screenshot, or summarize raw cookie values.
- Report cookie loading by count/domain and blocker, not by value.
- Keep persistent browser profile data under `~/.hypercore-business/profiles/` when continuity is needed.
- Save screenshots, result JSON, or downloaded files under `~/.hypercore-business/evidence/` or `~/.hypercore-business/downloads/` when useful.

Supported helper commands:

```bash
node skills/cloak-browser/scripts/cookie.mjs inspect --url https://www.coupang.com --json
node skills/cloak-browser/scripts/cookie.mjs import-json --site coupang --url https://www.coupang.com --from /path/to/chrome-cookies.json --json
node skills/cloak-browser/scripts/browser-utils.mjs init
node skills/cloak-browser/scripts/browser-utils.mjs cookies --url https://www.coupang.com --json
```

## 5. Executable Path Rules

- Validate any user-provided executable path with a local file check.
- Prefer the freshest valid cached path under `~/.cloakbrowser/chromium-*`.
- Use an absolute path in long-lived MCP config files.
- Keep the user's example form available for quick runs:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp --headless --executable-path ~/.cloakbrowser/chromium-146.0.7680.177.3/chrome
```

- For current installs, prefer `@latest` unless the user requests an exact package version:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --headless --executable-path ~/.cloakbrowser/chromium-146.0.7680.177.3/chrome
```

## 6. Headless Mode Rules

- Default to headless mode for this skill: include `--headless` in direct MCP launch commands and persistent MCP config.
- If the user says `headless false`, `headed`, `visible`, "브라우저 보이게", or asks to watch the browser, do not include `--headless`; Playwright MCP is headed by default.
- Confirm the selected mode in the handoff, especially when visible browsing was requested.
- Do not force a GUI browser when the environment cannot open one; report the environment blocker and keep the command/config ready for a GUI-capable surface.

## 7. Humanize Rules

Human-like mouse, keyboard, and scroll behavior is mandatory for this skill.

- For CloakBrowser JavaScript API launches, always include `humanize: true`.
- For persistent contexts, include `humanize: true` alongside `userDataDir` and the selected headless/headed mode.
- Do not treat Playwright MCP's `--executable-path` by itself as proof that CloakBrowser wrapper-level `humanize: true` is active. It proves the MCP server is pointed at the CloakBrowser executable, not that the JS wrapper applied humanization.
- If a CloakBrowser-aware MCP bridge or wrapper is available, use it only when it explicitly preserves `humanize: true`.
- If no surface can prove humanization for the requested live task, report the blocker. For action-heavy browsing, prefer a direct CloakBrowser JS-driver path with `humanize: true` over an executable-path-only MCP route.
- Completion evidence must say either `humanize: true` was verified for the actual launch path, or that the selected MCP route cannot prove humanization.

Required JS API shape:

```javascript
import { launch } from 'cloakbrowser';

const browser = await launch({
  humanize: true,
  headless: true
});
```

Visible/headed JS API shape:

```javascript
import { launchPersistentContext } from 'cloakbrowser';

const ctx = await launchPersistentContext({
  userDataDir: './chrome-profile',
  humanize: true,
  headless: false
});
```

## 8. MCP Configuration Patterns

Select the client surface deliberately.

### Codex TOML

```toml
[mcp_servers.cloak-browser]
command = "npx"
args = ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--headless", "--executable-path", "/absolute/path/to/chrome"]
```

### Standard JSON MCP Clients

Use this for Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code-style MCP config, and other clients whose docs accept `mcpServers` JSON:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloak-browser": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--headless", "--executable-path", "/absolute/path/to/chrome"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code CLI

When the user specifically asks for CLI setup, use the Playwright MCP documented CLI shape and include CloakBrowser args:

```bash
claude mcp add cloak-browser npx @playwright/mcp@latest --headless --executable-path /absolute/path/to/chrome
```

### Cursor

Cursor can use the standard JSON MCP server config. If a UI flow is required, add a new MCP server named `cloak-browser` with command `npx` and args `@playwright/mcp@latest`, `--headless`, `--executable-path`, and the absolute CloakBrowser path.

### Gajae-Code

Gajae-Code (`gjc`) is documented as an external coding-agent harness that runs beside existing tools and exposes skills/workflows. For Gajae-Code usage:

- Keep this folder as a normal skill folder.
- Apply the MCP server config to the underlying MCP-capable agent or client used inside the GJC session.
- Do not invent a GJC-specific MCP config path unless the local GJC installation documents one.
- If GJC is being used only as a workflow runner, provide the direct MCP command and the standard JSON/TOML config for the paired agent.

### Visible/Headed Override

```toml
[mcp_servers.cloak-browser]
command = "npx"
args = ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--executable-path", "/absolute/path/to/chrome"]
```

Only add extra MCP flags when they solve the current task. Common flags include `--user-data-dir`, `--storage-state`, `--allowed-origins`, `--blocked-origins`, `--device`, and `--config`.

## 9. Browser Task Execution

After MCP is configured, complete the user's browser task through that MCP surface:

- Navigate to the requested site.
- Interact only with elements needed for the task.
- Use `scripts/browser-utils.mjs` helper functions for repeated human-like mouse movement, clicks, typing, scrolling, and XPath lookup when driving CloakBrowser through the JavaScript API.
- Use `humanMove` and `humanClick` so pointer target position, movement steps, and pre-click pause are randomized within conservative human-paced ranges.
- Use `humanType` for typing work so text entry defaults to a randomized 250-270 characters per minute. Override with `delayMs` for a fixed delay or `minCpm`/`maxCpm` for another randomized range only when the user explicitly asks for another typing speed.
- Use `humanScroll` with `pixelsPerSecond`, `steps`, `pauseMs`, or `pauseJitter` when scroll speed needs to be slower, faster, or less regular for the task.
- Use user-provided credentials only within the active task and never store them in the skill folder.
- Prefer persistent profiles only when the user needs session continuity or a site penalizes incognito contexts.
- Report observed page state, extracted data, downloaded files, or verification screenshots/logs as appropriate.
- Close CloakBrowser cleanly after the task unless the user explicitly says to keep it open.

Default lifecycle:

```text
Run the preflight question gate
-> initialize ~/.hypercore-business/
-> load matching cookies from cookie.yml
-> launch CloakBrowser with humanize: true
-> perform the user's browser task
-> save useful evidence
-> close CloakBrowser unless told to keep it open
```

## 10. Troubleshooting Order

## 10. Reports and Image Evidence

When the user asks for analysis, reporting, auditing, research, content analysis, account analysis, or marketer-style review:

- Write the report in Korean by default, unless the user explicitly asks for another language.
- Save the report under `~/.hypercore-business/evidence/`, using a task-specific filename.
- Include concise screenshot or image evidence when it materially improves the report.
- Use absolute local Markdown image links for local screenshots, for example `![profile screenshot](/Users/name/.hypercore-business/evidence/site/profile.png)`.
- Keep report claims tied to observed browser state, screenshots, downloaded files, or saved JSON/log artifacts.
- Do not include raw cookie values, private tokens, or unrelated session data in the report.

## 11. Troubleshooting Order

Debug by layer:

1. Required preflight input is missing or ambiguous.
2. Node version is too old or missing.
3. Setup workspace is not writable or should not receive package changes.
4. `~/.hypercore-business/` cannot be created or written.
5. `cookie.yml` is malformed or contains no matching cookies for the target.
6. npm package install failed.
7. `npx @playwright/mcp@latest` cannot be invoked.
8. CloakBrowser binary download failed.
9. No executable exists under `~/.cloakbrowser`.
10. `humanize: true` is missing or cannot be proved for the actual launch path.
11. Client MCP config surface is unsupported or unknown.
12. Playwright MCP cannot start.
13. MCP starts but does not use CloakBrowser.
14. The target site blocks, challenges, or disallows the requested flow.

Do not jump to proxies, fingerprint seeds, persistent profiles, or extra stealth flags until the failing layer is identified and the use remains authorized.

## 12. Completion Evidence

A complete run should report:

- Node/npm checks when setup was performed
- preflight answers or explicit values for target, `headless`, cookie mode/account, and keep-open preference
- install, repair, or skip reason for `cloakbrowser`, `playwright-core`, `@playwright/mcp`, and the CloakBrowser binary
- runtime workspace path and cookie loading status without cookie values
- cookie normalization/import path used, especially when Chrome export JSON or `sameSite` conversion was involved
- resolved CloakBrowser executable path
- selected client surface and config format
- MCP launch command or config snippet
- selected mode: `headless` by default or `headed/visible` by explicit user request
- humanization status: `humanize: true` verified for the actual launch path, or executable-path-only MCP reported as insufficient evidence
- lifecycle status: closed cleanly or intentionally kept open by user request
- browser task result observed through MCP
- Korean report path and image evidence paths when a report was requested
- blocker and next-best local check if any step could not run
